# John Hazel's Explorations
This is a collection of random explorations, usually python scripts generated by ChatGPT typically when I have some random problem I'm trying to solve.

## Explorations
- **combine-csvs**: combine csv's, especially useful when ChatGPT can only export chunks of csv's
- **contacts-export-and-cleanup**: after downloading a vcf, convert it to csv & clean it up
- **drafts-actions**: actions for the Drafts App by agiletortoise
- **py-design**: using python to create graphic designs
- **split-audio**: split audio into chunks so when I put it on a flash drive and plug it into my car it's easy to skip around the hour-and-a-half long audio
- **transcribe-audio**: self-explanatory, used for transcribing audio podcast; the google one works best, the results from vosk was a joke; note the heavyweight google one will split the audio into <1 min chunks so they can process through google's free api
